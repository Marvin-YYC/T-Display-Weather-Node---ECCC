Weather Information Display for the TTGO T-display and information from Environment Canada (ECCC) / NavCanada weather stations

This is a work in progress.

I haven't added any additional fonts or other complications at this time.  I did set up the left button of the T-display to control the backlight.

Just a basic sketch to fetch current weather and weather alert data from Environment Canada and Nav Canada weather stations.

GO HERE>> https://dd.weather.gc.ca/today/observations/swob-ml/latest/  ->> to obtain the the SWOB Weather feed for your local weather station or airport. 
Note: Not all data fields are availbe for all stations all the time.  Fields showing "--" may not be available for all fetches.

GO HERE>> https://weather.gc.ca/  ->> to obtain the the ALERT RSS feed for your local alerts
Use the top right search bar and then scroll to the bottom.  Look for 'follow', the orange RSS feed icon, and select ALERTS
